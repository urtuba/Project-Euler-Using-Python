Solutions of Project Euler challenges using Python 3.9+. py files are not in structural hierarchy, they are standalone scripts. Dependencies are only `Python 3.9+` and well-known libraries like `numpy` for some solutions. You can run all scripts by calling them from terminal or ide. All solutions are implemented in one or more functions. Each script calculates problem for original inputs in project eulers when they are not imported.

# Solved Problems:
1. Multiples of 3 and 5
2. Fibonacci Numbers
3. Largest Prime Factor
4. Largest Palindrome Product
5. Smallest Multiple
6. Sum Square Difference
7. Nth Prime Number
8. Largest Product in Series
9. Special Pythagorean Triplet
10. Summation of Primes
11. Largest Product In a Grid
